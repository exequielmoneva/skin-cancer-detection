# skin-cancer-detection

## This notebook belongs to the following Kaggle's competition:https://www.kaggle.com/fanconic/skin-cancer-malignant-vs-benign
## Aditionally, I've uploaded a Google Colab's version, where you can find a simple function for testing the model with pictures. You can find pictures of skin cancer online or at the competition's dataset.
